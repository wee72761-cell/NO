/**
 * Client-side storage for the Forge API key the browser authenticates with.
 *
 * A fresh self-host has no other way in: the UI has no password login, and
 * `POST /auth/login` begins an OAuth handshake against an IdP that nobody has
 * configured yet. `make dev` therefore mints an admin key and prints it, and
 * this module is where the key the operator pastes into the Connect dialog
 * lives.
 *
 * **Where it is kept.** `sessionStorage` by default, so the credential dies
 * with the tab; "remember on this browser" promotes it to `localStorage`. That
 * default is deliberate: browser storage is scoped to an *origin*, and on
 * `http://localhost:<port>` that origin is shared with every other local app
 * that has ever used the same port — anything persisted there is readable by
 * them and vice versa. A long-lived admin token does not belong in that pool
 * unless its owner asks for it. See `docs/self-hosting/security.md`.
 *
 * Every access is wrapped: storage throws in private mode and in some embedded
 * webviews, and the app has to keep working when it does.
