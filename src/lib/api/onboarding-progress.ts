/**
 * Pure derivation for the guided-walkthrough onboarding progress.
 *
 * Framework-free (no React, no client) so the loop-stage roll-up is unit
 * testable in isolation and can be reused by both the typed API client
 * ({@link ForgeApiClient.getOnboardingProgress}) and the query hook.
 *
 * Each stage of the "create a spec -> run an agent -> review the PR -> merge"
 * loop is grounded in a real router read:
 *   - spec   : GET /projects/{id}/specs   (a spec exists)
 *   - run    : same specs, in `implementing` or beyond (an agent has begun work)
 *   - review : GET /approvals             (a PR review gate exists)
 *   - merge  : GET /projects/{id}/deployments (a deployment has succeeded)
