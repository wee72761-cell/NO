# Contributing to Forge

Thanks for helping build Forge! This guide covers local setup, the development
workflow, and the conventions we hold PRs to. By participating you agree to
follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Forge is licensed under [Apache-2.0](./LICENSE). Contributions are accepted
under the same license, and each commit must carry a
[Developer Certificate of Origin](#developer-certificate-of-origin-dco)
sign-off.

## Ways to contribute

- File clear, reproducible bug reports.
- Improve documentation (the `docs/` tree and inline docstrings).
- Add or fix a feature via a pull request.
- Add examples under [`examples/`](./examples) — every file there is executed as
  a test fixture, so an example can never silently drift from the schema.

If you are planning a non-trivial change, please open an issue to discuss it
first so we can agree on the approach before you invest the time.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.14** — the pinned version lives in [`.python-version`](./.python-version).
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — manages the Python workspace and virtualenv.
- **Node 22+** and **[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 10** — for the `apps/web` frontend.
- **Docker Engine 24+** with the **Docker Compose v2** plugin — to run the stack.
- **`make`** — the task runner entrypoint (see `make help`).

`uv` can install the right Python for you (`uv python install 3.14`).

## Development setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<org>/forge.git
cd forge
cp .env.example .env     # fill in local secrets; see the inline docs in .env.example
make setup               # uv sync + pnpm install
```

`make setup` installs the Python workspace (all `forge_*` packages, editable)
and the Node dependencies for `apps/web`. The Python workspace is defined in the
root [`pyproject.toml`](./pyproject.toml); the web app is a separate `pnpm`
workspace ([`pnpm-workspace.yaml`](./pnpm-workspace.yaml)).

## Running the local stack

The whole stack runs in Docker Compose. The one-command path builds the images,
starts every service, applies migrations, seeds a demo workspace, and waits for
health:

```bash
make dev        # docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.dev.yml, migrate + seed + healthcheck
```

- **Forge (the Caddy edge — use this):** <http://localhost:8080>
- API health check: <http://localhost:8080/api/health>

Caddy serves the UI and `/api/*` from one origin, so the browser needs no CORS
and everything resolves. The web (3000) and API (8000) ports are published for
debugging only — a browser pointed at 3000 has no `/api` to reach.

`make dev` also prints a one-time **admin API key**; paste it into the UI's
Connect dialog. Every API route is authenticated and there is no password login
yet, so this is how you get in. `scripts/dev.sh seed` prints a fresh one.

Useful stack commands:

```bash
make dev-logs               # follow all logs (make dev-logs svc=api for one service)
make dev-seed               # re-run the idempotent demo-workspace seed
make dev-down               # stop the stack (named volumes are kept)
```

If you prefer to run pieces on the host, you can drive the database directly:

```bash
make migrate     # alembic upgrade head
make seed        # seed a demo workspace
```

To validate the **production** compose stack locally, use the digest-pinned
production file and the smoke target:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml config --quiet   # what CI validates
make smoke                                                   # up -> healthy -> /health -> down -v
```

## Tests, linting, and the green gate

CI is the source of truth, and it must be green before a PR can merge. Run the
same checks locally.

**Python** (from the repo root):

```bash
make test        # uv run pytest
make lint        # ruff check . + ruff format --check .
make typecheck   # mypy (module-mode, per the Makefile package list)
make fmt         # auto-format + auto-fix before you push
```

Some Python tests need a live pgvector-enabled Postgres; they skip cleanly if
one is not available (CI runs them against a real `pgvector/pgvector:pg16`
service). Tests are marked (`postgres`, `integration`, `docker`, `security`,
`kind`, `gvisor`, `firecracker`) so you can select or skip tiers, e.g.
`uv run pytest -m security`.

**Web** (`apps/web`):

```bash
pnpm --filter @forge/web lint
pnpm --filter @forge/web build
pnpm --filter @forge/web test
```

**Before opening a PR**, make sure:

- `uv run ruff check .` is clean and `ruff format --check` passes;
- `make typecheck` passes;
- `uv run pytest` passes;
- if you touched `apps/web`, its lint + build + test pass;
- no secrets are committed — a `gitleaks` gate runs in CI and blocks on hits.

We practise test-driven development: add a failing test, implement, then confirm
the green gate. New behaviour should ship with tests.

## Development workflow (trunk-based)

Forge uses **trunk-based development** against a single long-lived branch,
`main`. `main` is always releasable and protected.

1. **Branch short-lived** off up-to-date `main`. Keep branches small and merge
   them quickly — hours to a couple of days, not weeks. Suggested naming:
   `feat/<slug>`, `fix/<slug>`, `docs/<slug>`, `chore/<slug>`.
   ```bash
   git switch main && git pull --ff-only
   git switch -c feat/my-change
   ```
2. **Commit** in small, logical steps using [Conventional Commits](#commit-conventions)
   and a DCO sign-off (`git commit -s`).
3. **Open a pull request** into `main`. Fill in what changed and why, and link
   any related issue. Keep PRs focused and reviewable.
4. **Pass CI + get one review.** A PR merges only when:
   - all required CI jobs are green (Python lint/types/tests, web lint/build,
     the security gate, secrets-config preflight, and compose validation), and
   - it has **at least one approving review**.
5. **Squash-merge to `main`.** We squash so `main` keeps one clean, conventional
   commit per change. Make the squash commit's title a valid Conventional Commit
   and keep its body carrying the DCO sign-off. Delete the branch after merge.

Rebase your branch on `main` rather than merging `main` into it, to keep history
linear and your diff honest.

## Commit conventions

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). The subject
is `type(scope): summary`, imperative mood, lower-case, no trailing period.

Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`,
`ci`, `chore`. Scope is optional but encouraged (a package, app, or feature id),
for example:

```
feat(knowledge): add RRF fusion tie-breaking
fix(api): reject expired agent tokens on the wired path
docs: polish the self-host quickstart
```

The conventional-commit format is **enforced**, not just recommended: the
changelog and the SemVer bump are derived from it. Install the local guard once:

```bash
make hooks        # installs a commit-msg hook running `uv run cz check`
```

You can validate a message by hand with `uv run cz check --commit-msg-file <file>`,
and CI runs `cz check` over the PR commit range. Cutting a release is a single
command for maintainers — `make bump` (`uv run cz bump`) computes the next SemVer
from the commit history, rewrites the version in every package in lockstep, and
regenerates [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md). See `release/` and
[`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml).

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Forge uses the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)
instead of a CLA. It is a lightweight statement that you wrote the patch or
otherwise have the right to submit it under the project's license.

**Every commit must be signed off.** Add the sign-off automatically with the
`-s` / `--signoff` flag:

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat(board): add column reordering"
```

This appends a trailer to the commit message with your real name and email:

```
Signed-off-by: Jane Developer <jane@example.com>
```

Configure your identity once with `git config user.name` and
`git config user.email` so the sign-off is accurate. Forgot to sign off? Amend
the last commit with `git commit --amend -s` (or `git rebase --signoff` for a
range), then force-push your branch.

## Reporting bugs and security issues

- **Bugs / features:** open a GitHub issue with a minimal reproduction, the
  affected component, and the version or commit.
- **Security vulnerabilities:** please do **not** open a public issue. Follow
  the private reporting process in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

Thanks again for contributing to Forge.
