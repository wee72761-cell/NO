Forge turns a written spec into orchestrated engineering work: a spec engine
plans and validates the work, a LangGraph agent runtime executes it inside
isolated sandboxes, a hybrid (semantic + keyword) knowledge pipeline grounds the
agents in your codebase, and a native board tracks it all. It is designed to be
**self-hosted first** — every component ships in a single, hardened Docker
Compose stack (or a Helm chart) that you own end to end.

spec, run an agent, review the PR, merge &
ship.](./docs/assets/screenshots/walkthrough.png)

## Status

Forge is **pre-1.0 and under active development** — usable for evaluation and
self-host testing, **not yet for production**. The backend platform, HTTP API,
CLI, workflow/agent runtime, and self-hosting substrate are the mature surface,
exercised by a large test suite (~3,700 tests on real pgvector Postgres, green
in CI). The **web UI ships 15 feature screens** — `approvals`, `audit`,
`board`, `deployments`, `depth`, `incidents`, `leaderboard`, `marketplace`,
`observability`, `runs`, `settings` (SSO/OIDC/SCIM, RBAC, PM integrations,
model BYOK), `specs`, `sprints`, `walkthrough`, and `workflow` — on the Forge
design system. Some screens carry **honestly marked gaps** where a backend
projection or live credential is pending (e.g. a couple of dashboard
projections), and the
third-party integrations (GitHub App, model BYOK, reranker, MCP, Slack) are
code-complete with tests + runbooks but need **your keys** to verify live. We
try hard not to advertise anything that is only parked — the pre-1.0 notice at
the top of this README, this Status section, and
[`RELEASE_READINESS.md`](./RELEASE_READINESS.md) track the honest status, and
individual screens mark in-progress areas inline.

## Key features

- **Spec-driven development** — author a `manifest.yaml` spec; the spec engine
  validates it and drives the work. Includes a spec-validation dashboard.
- **Agent runtime** — a LangGraph agent loop that runs work inside sandboxed
  execution (`worktree` git-worktree isolation by default, a per-task Docker
  `container` sandbox also available; gVisor / Firecracker isolation classes
  are modelled and mapped, with the real-runtime tiers gated behind a
  virtualization-enabled CI job).
- **Multi-agent coordination** — a coordinator for fanning work across agents.
- **Workflow engine** — a Postgres finite-state-machine workflow layer, with
  Temporal available in the production stack for durable orchestration.
- **Hybrid knowledge / RAG** — pgvector cosine search + Postgres full-text
  (BM25-style) fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (k=60) and a reranker.
- **Native project board** — a board core for tracking runs and work items.
- **Policy, skill, integration & MCP SDKs** — declarative `.forge/policy.yaml`,
  skill profiles, integration definitions, and an MCP gateway for tool sources.
- **Integration marketplace** — browse, install, and publish integrations
  from the in-app UI (the offline `forge marketplace package` CLI works too).
- **Enterprise SSO / SCIM** — SAML SSO and OIDC, plus SCIM provisioning, with
  an admin UI (live IdP verification needs your own IdP, like the third-party
  integrations above).
- **Human approval system** — gated approvals for sensitive agent actions.
- **Benchmark leaderboard** — submit, verify, and rank agent benchmark runs,
  with a public leaderboard UI.
- **Auth, secrets & BYOK** — envelope-encrypted secrets, a key vault, and
  bring-your-own-key model-provider credentials.
- **Observability & cost metrics + audit log** — structured, redaction-aware
  telemetry and an append-only audit trail.
- **Self-hosting & security** — a hardened, digest-pinned Compose stack, a Helm
  chart, per-image SBOMs, backup/restore runbooks, a STRIDE threat model, and a
  wired enforcement-matrix regression suite enforced in CI.

## Quickstart (self-host, one command)

Requires Docker Engine 24+ and the Docker Compose v2 plugin, plus `make`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QuintinBotes/forge.git
cd forge
cp .env.example .env     # then set FORGE_SECRET_KEY, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, DOMAIN, ...
make dev                 # build + start the full stack, migrate, seed, wait healthy
```

`make dev` brings up Postgres (pgvector), Redis, MinIO, the API, worker, MCP
gateway, web UI, and the Caddy edge proxy, then runs migrations and seeds a demo
workspace. When it reports healthy:

- **Forge (the Caddy edge — use this):** <http://localhost:8080>
- API health check: <http://localhost:8080/api/health>

Caddy serves the UI and `/api/*` from one origin, so the browser needs no CORS
and everything resolves. The web (3000) and API (8000) ports are published for
debugging only — a browser pointed at 3000 has no `/api` to reach.

`make dev` also prints a one-time **admin API key**; paste it into the UI's
Connect dialog. Every API route is authenticated and there is no password login
yet, so this is how you get in. `scripts/dev.sh seed` prints a fresh one.

For a **production** deployment (hardened, digest-pinned images) use the
production compose file directly:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d --remove-orphans
```

See [`docs/self-hosting/quickstart.md`](./docs/self-hosting/quickstart.md) for
the full walkthrough, and [`deploy/`](./deploy) for the Compose files, Caddy
config, and Helm chart.

The Python workspace is managed by `uv` (members declared in the root
[`pyproject.toml`](./pyproject.toml)). The web app is a separate `pnpm`
workspace ([`pnpm-workspace.yaml`](./pnpm-workspace.yaml)) and is excluded from
the uv workspace.

## Development

```bash
make setup      # uv sync + pnpm install
make dev        # bring up the full local stack (build, migrate, seed, healthcheck)
make test       # uv run pytest
make lint       # ruff check + ruff format --check
```

| Command          | Description                                    |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `make setup`     | Install Python (uv) + Node (pnpm) deps         |
| `make dev`       | Build + start the full dev stack via Compose   |
| `make test`      | Run the Python test suite (pytest)             |
| `make lint`      | Ruff lint + format check                       |
| `make fmt`       | Ruff auto-format + auto-fix                    |
| `make typecheck` | mypy static type checking                      |
| `make migrate`   | Apply Alembic migrations                       |
| `make seed`      | Seed a demo workspace                          |

Web-app checks run through pnpm:

```bash
pnpm --filter @forge/web lint
pnpm --filter @forge/web build
pnpm --filter @forge/web test
```

TDD is the norm and CI is the source of truth: `ruff check`, `ruff format
--check`, `mypy`, and `pytest` (against a real pgvector Postgres) must be green,
and the web job must lint + build. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for
the full workflow.
